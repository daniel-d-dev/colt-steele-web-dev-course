# The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele

This repository contains various projects that were created during The Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. The projects below range from simple static pages to dynamic applications with API integrations. The majority of the projects have been enhanced and customised from the original code-along tutorials to both to improve usability and to solidify my skills and understanding of web development concepts.
