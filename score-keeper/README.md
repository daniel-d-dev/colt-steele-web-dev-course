# Score Keeper
https://daniel-d-dev.github.io/colt-steele-web-dev-course/score-keeper/

This is a web-based application designed to track scores for a ping pong (or similar) game. Players can increase their scores using the buttons, set a target score (either 11 or 21 points), and view the current score in real-time. When a player reaches the target score, the game ends, and the winner is highlighted. A reset button allows the game to start over.

# Technologies Used
* HTML: Structures the page and defines elements like buttons and score displays.
* CSS (Bulma): Provides the styling, including layout and interactive components like buttons.
* JavaScript: Handles game logic, including updating scores, checking if a player has won, and resetting the game.
