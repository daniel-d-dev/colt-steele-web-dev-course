# Console-based To-Do List
https://daniel-d-dev.github.io/colt-steele-web-dev-course/todo-list/

This project is a simple, console-based to-do list application implemented using HTML and JavaScript. The application allows users to manage their to-do list through a series of commands such as adding new tasks, listing tasks, and deleting tasks. It uses the prompt method to interact with the user and console.log to display information to the user.

This to-do list operates entirely within the browserâ€™s console, offering a lightweight and accessible way for users to organise and track tasks. The application runs in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple actions until they choose to quit. No external libraries were used in this project. The functionality is based entirely on vanilla JavaScript and browser-native methods.

## Technologies Used
* HTML: Simple structure to display commands and information on the page.
* JavaScript: Handles the functionality of the to-do list, including adding, listing, deleting, and quitting.
